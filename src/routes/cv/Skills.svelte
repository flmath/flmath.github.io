  Professionally I work as an Erlang programmer developing Session Border Controller node in IMS network.
  The technical stack is based on Linux, the above mentioned Erlang, Git/Gerrit as the project version control system,
  and Jenkins for CI/CD. Throughout my career,
  I was working in Agile teams (usually in SCRUM methodology) tasked with the end-to-end process of delivering requested feature.
  I was usually responsible for: analyzing requirements,
  evaluating feasibility and designing solutions, implementing solutions, writing function tests.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of feature work I also implement tools for development environments I work in.
  For example, I have written in Python a tool to parse HTML test logs into an SQLite database (to enable more advanced analysis').
  Python is my favorite scripting language, I usually use Anaconda to have access to libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Jupyter.
  Participation in various projects and courses taught me a lot of different languages (and frameworks). 
  Among ones I have used recently are React, Matlab/Octave, R, and SQL(SQLite).
  I have two GitHub accounts where I'm keeping my public projects.
  The main repository contains accomplished projects and active ones like this blog.
  The "dirty" repository contains less clean code and projects queued for cleaning.
  For example, web graphics application for Erlang Common Test is in the "dirty" repository because it uses an outdated front end
  framework (AngularJs) and a back end framework (Cowboy) with broken dependency.

  The first programming language I have learned was C++, I have been some time since I have used it, but it does not mean I have anything against it.
