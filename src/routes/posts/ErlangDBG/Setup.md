The tracing_experiments application is very simple gen_statem written specifically to test debugging facilities. 
You can find it on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/flmath/tracing_experiments). 
All experiments are run in a shell started with: 
```bash 
 $ local_rebar/rebar3 as dbg shell 
```
for a clear view.
